## 🔧 Common Vercel Issues & Fixes

### ❌ Problem: "404 - File Not Found"
**Cause**: Missing `index.html` or wrong file structure
**Solution**:
```
✅ Correct structure:
your-project/
├── index.html (must be in root)
├── index.css
├── app.js
└── images...

❌ Wrong structure:
your-project/
└── website-folder/
    ├── index.html (too deep!)
    └── other files...
```

### ❌ Problem: Images Not Loading
**Cause**: Wrong image paths
**Solution**: Ensure all image paths are relative (no `/` at start):
```html
<!-- ✅ Correct -->
<img src="background.jpg" alt="Background">

<!-- ❌ Wrong -->
<img src="/background.jpg" alt="Background">
```

### ❌ Problem: CSS/JS Not Loading
**Cause**: Wrong file paths in HTML
**Solution**: Check your HTML file links:
```html
<!-- ✅ Correct -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
<script src="app.js"></script>

<!-- ❌ Wrong -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/index.css">
<script src="/app.js"></script>
```

### ❌ Problem: Site Loads But Looks Broken
**Cause**: Missing files or wrong MIME types
**Solution**:
1. Check all files uploaded correctly
2. Verify `vercel.json` is included
3. Redeploy the project

## 🎯 Vercel Configuration File

I've created a `vercel.json` file for you that:

Keep this file in your project root!

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want `www.taureanschools.com` instead of `random-name.vercel.app`?

### Free Option:

## 📊 Monitoring Your Website

### Vercel Analytics (Free)

### Google Analytics (Free)
Add this code before `</head>` in `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```
